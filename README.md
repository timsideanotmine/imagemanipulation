# imagemanipulation
Image manipulation in Numpy (Syntra) : Created by Johan Van Erum, monday 12th of February 2024

This coding to be evaluated by Tim Horemans, so he can quote the code for this part of the course.
Please have a look at the /documentation/assignment.md file to check on what exactly was asked 

## How to set up the enviroment IMAGEMANIPULATION
open a conda powershell prompt, activate the base enviroment if necessary 
go the the root level of the \IMAGEMANIPULATION folder by using cd, best to have the root folder as the current directoy

execute 'conda env create -f <drive>:<path\path\>environment.yaml

replace <drive> with the appropriate drive letter, <path\path\> with the 
actuale folder levels up to the folder ..\IMAGEMANIPULATION

## After setup, how to run the code?

activate the enviroment 
(base) PS D:\cloud\github\imagemanipulation> conda activate imagemanipulation
(imagemanipulation) PS D:\cloud\github\imagemanipulation>

run the code in the main.py file, this will show the 3 images - consecutivly - requested in the assigment

(imagemanipulation) PS D:\cloud\github\imagemanipulation> python main.py

You should see respectively:
1. tiled image 8 x 3, close the window
2. hstack.vstack image 6 x 4, close the window
3. clockwise colorful image, 4 x 4, close the window to end
run the code in the main.py file, this will show the 3 images - consecutivly - requested in the assigment
(imagemanipulation) PS D:\cloud\github\imagemanipulation> python main.py
